# YOUR TASK: Create a Comprehensive Learning Strategy

This is a **strategic planning document** for the tutor, NOT individual lesson plans.

Think like an educational strategist. Address:

## 1. PEDAGOGICAL PHILOSOPHY (2-3 paragraphs)
- Why this approach for THIS specific student?
- How does it honor their learning style, interests, and cultural background?
- What's your theory of change for their learning over {len(week_topics)} weeks?
- How will you build trust and intrinsic motivation?

## 2. BIG IDEAS & ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS
- What are the 3-4 **big ideas** that connect all {len(week_topics)} weeks?
- What **essential questions** will drive inquiry? (e.g., "How do forces shape our world?")
- Why does this learning matter beyond the classroom?

## 3. LEARNING PROGRESSION & SCAFFOLDING
For each week, describe:
- **Week N: [Topic]**
  - **Conceptual Focus**: What big idea(s) does this week explore?
  - **Learning Goals**: What will the student be able to *think about* or *do* differently?
  - **Key Concepts**: 3-4 core concepts (with brief explanations)
  - **Cognitive Progression**: How does this build on prior weeks and prepare for future ones?
  - **Common Misconceptions**: What misunderstandings should the tutor anticipate?
  - **Differentiation Notes**: How to adapt if student struggles or excels?

## 4. FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT STRATEGY
- How will the tutor **check for understanding** throughout (not just at the end)?
- What **success indicators** show the student is progressing?
- What **dialogue questions** can reveal student thinking?
- How will you assess both conceptual understanding AND skill development?

## 5. DIFFERENTIATION & STUDENT-CENTERED ADAPTATIONS
- How to adjust pacing for {student.get('learning_style', 'this student')}?
- What **choice points** can you offer to honor student agency?
- How to connect abstract concepts to {', '.join(student.get('interests', [])[:2])} (student's interests)?
- Cultural responsiveness: How to respect {student.get('nationality', 'International')} perspective?

## 6. RESOURCES & KNOWLEDGE INTEGRATION
- Curated list of **high-quality resources** from the research (include URLs)
- Mix of: interactive simulations, videos, articles, primary sources
- Note which resources work best for which weeks

## 7. REFLECTION & METACOGNITION
- How will you help the student become aware of their OWN learning process?
- What **reflection prompts** can you use weekly?
- How will you celebrate growth and normalize struggle?

---

**IMPORTANT**:
- Be **creative and thoughtful**, not formulaic
- Write in **rich paragraphs**, not bullet lists (except where bullets clarify)
- Think like a **master teacher planning a transformative learning experience**
- This is a STRATEGY document - specific activities will come later in lesson plans
- Include specific **credible sources** (URLs) from the research provided
- Make it **personalized** to {student['name']}'s needs and interests

Write the complete strategy in **markdown format**. Be thorough and pedagogically sophisticated.
