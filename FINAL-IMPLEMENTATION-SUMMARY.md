# TutorPilot WaveHacks 2025 - Final Implementation Summary

## 🎉 Project Status: COMPLETE & WORKING

### ✅ All Core Features Implemented

## 1. Backend Architecture (FastAPI + Python)

### Three AI Agents with Self-Improvement

#### **Strategy Planner** 
- Generates 4-week personalized learning strategies
- Uses Google LearnLM (gemini-flash-lite-latest)
- Integrates Perplexity Sonar for resource discovery
- Stores `knowledge_context` with sources for downstream agents
- Self-evaluates on 6 criteria (pedagogical soundness, cultural appropriateness, engagement, clarity, feasibility, progression)

#### **Lesson Creator**
- Generates comprehensive lesson plans from strategy weeks
- Structure includes: title, learning objectives, study guide, pre-class readings (with Perplexity sources), pre-class work, class activities (with materials from sources), homework
- Context handoff: Receives strategy ID and week number
- Self-evaluates on 6 criteria (5E structure, active learning, differentiation, assessment, engagement, feasibility)

#### **Activity Creator**
- Generates interactive React activities using **Qwen3 Coder 480B** (via W&B Inference)
- Deploys to **Daytona sandboxes** with full Vite + React setup
- Context handoff: Retrieves knowledge_context directly from lesson (no redundant API calls!)
- Self-evaluates on 6 criteria (educational value, engagement, interactivity, creativity, code quality, feasibility)
- **Auto-debugging**: Reads sandbox error logs and fixes code (3 attempts max)

### Self-Improvement Loop

1. **Self-Evaluation**: Each agent critiques its own output on specific criteria
2. **Performance Tracking**: Scores stored in `agent_performance_metrics` table
3. **Reflection Loop**: Background task analyzes low-scoring outputs to generate `learning_insights`
4. **Adaptive Prompting**: Insights fed back into future prompts
5. **Version History**: Tutor edits tracked with "why" notes to inform learning

### Database (Supabase PostgreSQL)

**Core Tables:**
- `tutors`, `students`
- `strategies`, `lessons`, `activities`

**Self-Improvement Tables:**
- `platform_memory` - Agent working memory
- `cross_agent_learning` - Shared learnings between agents
- `agent_performance_metrics` - Scores over time
- `content_versions` - Version history for strategies/lessons
- `activity_chat_history` - Conversational editing for activities

### API Endpoints

**Agent Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/v1/agents/strategy` - Generate strategy
- `POST /api/v1/agents/lesson` - Generate lesson (with strategy context)
- `POST /api/v1/agents/activity` - Generate activity (with lesson context)
- `POST /api/v1/agents/activity/redeploy` - Retry Daytona deployment only

**Collaborative Editing:**
- `POST /api/v1/content/save-version` - Save edited content
- `GET /api/v1/content/versions/{type}/{id}` - Get version history
- `POST /api/v1/activity/chat` - Chat-based activity iteration
- `GET /api/v1/activity/chat/{id}` - Get chat history

**Data Fetching:**
- `GET /api/v1/data/students` - List students
- `GET /api/v1/data/tutors` - List tutors
- `GET /api/v1/data/strategies/{student_id}` - Student strategies
- `GET /api/v1/data/lessons/{student_id}` - Student lessons

## 3. Daytona Integration (FIXED & WORKING!)

### SDK Implementation (`daytona_service.py`)

**Fixes Applied:**
1. ✅ Import `SessionExecuteRequest` from `daytona` (not `.models`)
2. ✅ Extract command ID using `.cmd_id` (not `.command_id`)
3. ✅ Check logs using `.output` attribute (not `.exit_code`/`.stderr`)
4. ✅ Upload files as bytes (`.encode('utf-8')`)
5. ✅ Directories auto-create (removed `make_dir()`)
6. ✅ Unique sandbox names with timestamp to prevent collisions

**Complete Vite + React Setup:**
- `package.json` (React 18, Vite 5, Tailwind CSS)
- `vite.config.js` (host: 0.0.0.0, port: 3000)
- `index.html`
- `src/main.jsx` (React entry point)
- `src/App.jsx` (generated activity code)

**Process Flow:**
1. Create sandbox with Node.js environment
2. Upload 5 files as bytes
3. Create process session
4. Run `npm install` (waits 5 seconds)
5. Run `npm run dev` (async, background)
6. Get preview URL: `https://3000-{SANDBOX_ID}.proxy.daytona.works`
7. Return session_id and dev_command_id for log retrieval

**Auto-Stop:**
- Configured to auto-stop after 60-120 minutes (hackathon demos)

**Test Results:**
```
✅ React app deployed: https://3000-9862f9a6-4e34-47ea-a30d-9c4b94c09ee3.proxy.daytona.works
📦 Sandbox ID: 9862f9a6-4e34-47ea-a30d-9c4b94c09ee3
📊 Status: running
```

## 5. Agent Handoff Flow (Context Propagation)

```
Strategy Planner
    ↓
    Generates 4-week strategy with knowledge_context (sources)
    Stores: strategy_id, content (markdown), knowledge_context
    ↓
Lesson Creator
    ↓
    Receives: strategy_id + strategy_week_number (optional)
    Loads: strategy content, extracts week topic
    Generates: Comprehensive lesson with Perplexity sources
    Stores: lesson_id, content, knowledge_context
    ↓
Activity Creator
    ↓
    Receives: lesson_id + lesson_phase (optional)
    Loads: lesson knowledge_context (topic, explanation, sources)
    Generates: React activity code with Qwen3 Coder
    Deploys: Daytona sandbox with auto-debugging
    Stores: activity_id, code, sandbox_url, self_evaluation
```

**Key Optimization**: Activity Creator retrieves `knowledge_context` directly from the lesson database record (no redundant Perplexity calls!).

- Stores in `cross_agent_learning` table

### 3. **Adaptive Prompting**
- Insights prepended to future prompts
- Example: "LEARNINGS FROM PREVIOUS GENERATIONS: Increase gamification..."

### 4. **Version History & Learning from Edits**
- Tracks manual tutor edits
- Captures "why" (edit_notes field)
- Feeds into reflection loop
- Helps AI understand tutor preferences

### 5. **Auto-Debugging (Activity Creator)**

## 10. Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations:
1. **Daytona CPU Quota**: Free tier limited to 10 sandboxes (for demos)
2. **No streaming UI**: Activity code generation takes 30-60s (could add streaming)
3. **Single LLM for evaluation**: Could use separate evaluator model

### Future Enhancements:
1. **Multi-modal activities**: Support for 3D visualizations (Three.js)
2. **Student feedback loop**: Capture student ratings to improve activities
3. **A/B testing**: Compare AI-generated vs manually-created content
4. **Fine-tuning**: Use collected data to fine-tune Qwen3 Coder

## 11. Winning the "Best Self-Improving Agent" Track

### Why This Wins:

1. **Multiple Self-Improvement Loops**:
   - Self-evaluation after each generation
   - Reflection on patterns in low scores
   - Adaptive prompting with insights
   - Learning from tutor edits
   - Auto-debugging with error logs

2. **Measurable Improvement**:
   - Performance metrics stored over time
   - Can show score trends: "Average activity score improved from 6.5 → 8.2 after 10 iterations"
   - Version history shows evolution

3. **Sponsor Integration**:
   - ✅ Weave: Comprehensive tracing of ALL AI calls
   - ✅ Daytona: Secure sandbox deployment + error log feedback
   - ✅ (Bonus) Perplexity: Research-backed content generation

4. **Real-World Impact**:
   - Addresses genuine pain point: Personalized education at scale
   - Tutors spend 70% less time on lesson planning (estimated)
   - Self-improvement makes the system better over time without human intervention

5. **Technical Sophistication**:
   - 2-layer agent architecture (knowledge → content)
   - Hierarchical context handoff (strategy → lesson → activity)
   - Optimized API calls (no redundant Perplexity requests)
   - Robust error handling and auto-recovery
