# Prompt Reference Guide - Copy from Existing Agents

This guide helps you quickly find and copy the proven prompts from existing Supabase Edge Functions.

## üîç Weave Tracing Integration

**IMPORTANT**: All AI model calls (LearnLM, Perplexity, Qwen3 Coder) will use Weave for tracing and debugging.

```python
import weave

# Initialize Weave once in main.py
weave.init("tutorpilot-weavehacks")

# Wrap ALL AI functions with @weave.op() decorator
@weave.op()
async def call_google_learnlm(prompt: str) -> str:
    # Your implementation
    pass

@weave.op()
async def call_perplexity(prompt: str) -> str:
    # Your implementation
    pass

@weave.op()
async def call_qwen3_coder(prompt: str) -> str:
    # Your implementation
    pass

# This automatically traces:
# - Input prompts
# - Output responses
# - Execution time
# - Token usage
# - All parameters
```

**Benefits for Demo**:
- Show judges the agent's decision-making process
- Debug evaluation reasoning in real-time
- Visualize improvement over generations
- Track prompt adaptations

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY - CREATE A FUN, MEMORABLE LEARNING EXPERIENCE:

Your goal is to create an engaging, interactive educational experience that feels like a game, simulation, or adventure - NOT a traditional worksheet or quiz. Think of this as building an educational game or interactive exploration tool.

**ACTIVITY TYPES TO INSPIRE YOU** (Choose what fits best):

1. **Interactive Simulations**: 
   - Scientific phenomena visualization (physics, chemistry, biology)
   - Mathematical concept explorers (geometry, algebra, calculus)
   - Historical event simulators or timelines
   - Economic/social system models

2. **Educational Games**:
   - Puzzle-based learning (solve to progress)
   - Strategy games teaching concepts
   - Adventure/quest games with educational challenges
   - Building/construction games (molecules, circuits, ecosystems)

3. **Role-Playing Scenarios**:
   - Historical figure perspectives
   - Scientific method investigations
   - Literary character journeys
   - Professional role simulations (scientist, engineer, historian)

4. **Interactive Laboratories**:
   - Virtual experiments with variables
   - Data collection and analysis tools
   - Hypothesis testing environments
   - Creative design studios

5. **Story-Driven Explorations**:
   - Narrative with educational decision points
   - Mystery-solving with clues based on concepts
   - Journey through historical events
   - Character-driven concept explanations

---

**ENGAGEMENT PRINCIPLES** (Make it FUN, not just educational):

1. **Intrinsic Motivation** (not just points):
   - Curiosity-driven exploration (discover secrets, unlock mysteries)
   - Meaningful choices that affect outcomes
   - Creative expression opportunities
   - Sense of mastery and progression
   - Surprising "aha!" moments
   - Emotional connection to content

2. **Game Feel** (what makes it enjoyable):
   - Smooth, responsive interactions
   - Satisfying visual/audio feedback
   - Delightful animations and transitions
   - Sense of agency and control
   - Clear but non-linear progression
   - Replayability with different outcomes
   - Easter eggs or hidden features

3. **Active Learning Integration**:
   - Learning happens through DOING, not reading
   - Concepts emerge from experimentation
   - Students discover patterns themselves
   - Immediate visual feedback shows cause-effect
   - Multiple paths to understanding
   - Mistakes are interesting, not punishing

4. **Engagement Hooks** (optional, use what fits):
   - Progress indicators (if it enhances experience)
   - Achievement recognition (meaningful milestones, not arbitrary points)
   - Unlockable content (new features, areas, or tools)
   - Narrative progression (story unfolds as they learn)
   - Challenge modes (optional harder versions)
   - Customization options (choose colors, characters, approaches)

---

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**

Generate a COMPLETE, self-contained React component that creates an engaging educational experience. Your output should include:

1. **All necessary imports** (React hooks, any helpers)
2. **Main component** with thoughtful state management
3. **Game/simulation logic** that makes concepts discoverable
4. **Rich interactivity** (not just click-to-advance)
5. **Visual feedback** (animations, transitions, effects)
6. **Natural learning integration** (concepts emerge from play)
7. **Beautiful UI** with Tailwind CSS (modern, polished)
8. **Helpful comments** explaining educational intent and mechanics

**STRUCTURE FREEDOM:**

- NO REQUIRED STRUCTURE - design what makes sense for the activity!
- Could be: game with levels, open sandbox, story-driven, puzzle-based, etc.
- Avoid rigid "stage 1, stage 2" patterns unless they truly fit
- Let the activity type guide the structure naturally

**IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:**

‚úÖ **Use**:
- React with hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo, etc.)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Modern JavaScript/JSX features
- CSS animations and transitions
- Canvas API or SVG for custom graphics (if helpful)

‚ùå **Don't use**:
- External libraries (no axios, no framer-motion, etc.)
- API calls or data fetching
- File system access
- localStorage (should work in sandbox)
- Dangerous operations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Safety Requirements**:
- Must run safely in Daytona sandbox
- No security vulnerabilities
- Handles edge cases gracefully
- Production-ready code quality

üéØ **Educational Requirements**:
- Concepts must be scientifically/historically accurate
- Age-appropriate for grade level
- Multiple ways to discover the main concepts
- Engaging without sacrificing educational value

---

**FINAL REMINDER - THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART:**

üåü **Make it FUN first, educational second.** If students don't want to engage with it, they won't learn. Create something they'll actually WANT to use, then ensure the learning happens naturally through interaction.

Think: "What would make ME want to play/explore this?" then add the educational content into that experience.

The best educational activities don't feel like learning - they feel like play, discovery, or adventure.

**BE BOLD. BE CREATIVE. MAKE SOMETHING MEMORABLE!** üöÄ

### 6. Code Error Fixing Prompt (NEW - Self-Debugging Loop)

After deploying generated code to Daytona sandbox, check for errors and fix them automatically.

**Python implementation**:
```python
def build_code_fix_prompt(
    original_code: str,
    error_logs: str,
    topic: str,
    attempt_number: int
):
    """Generate prompt for fixing code errors from sandbox"""
    
    return f"""You are debugging React code that was deployed to a sandbox and encountered errors.

ORIGINAL TOPIC: {topic}
ATTEMPT NUMBER: {attempt_number}/3

DEPLOYED CODE:
```jsx
{original_code[:2000]}...  # Show relevant portion
```

ERROR LOGS FROM SANDBOX:
```
{error_logs}
```

---

**YOUR TASK**: Fix the code to eliminate ALL errors while maintaining the educational and interactive experience.

**DEBUGGING APPROACH**:

1. **Analyze the Error**:
   - Identify the root cause (syntax error, logic error, missing imports, etc.)
   - Check if it's a React-specific issue (hooks, state, lifecycle)
   - Look for Tailwind CSS class issues
   - Check for JavaScript errors (undefined variables, type mismatches)

2. **Fix Strategy**:
   - Make MINIMAL changes to fix the error
   - Don't remove features - fix them properly
   - Ensure all state updates are correct
   - Verify all event handlers are properly bound
   - Check all conditional rendering logic

3. **Common Issues to Watch For**:
   - Missing dependencies in useEffect
   - Incorrect hook usage (calling hooks conditionally)
   - Unescaped characters in JSX
   - Missing closing tags
   - Incorrect prop types
   - Using undefined variables
   - Math operations on undefined/null values

4. **Testing Mentally**:
   - Walk through the user flow
   - Verify all interactive elements work
   - Check edge cases (empty states, boundary conditions)
   - Ensure no infinite loops or memory leaks

**OUTPUT**: 

Return the COMPLETE, FIXED React component code. Include:
- All necessary fixes for the reported errors
- Comments explaining what was fixed and why
- Any additional defensive programming to prevent similar errors
- The full, working component (don't truncate)

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Fix the actual problem, don't just remove features
- Maintain ALL the educational and interactive elements
- Keep the code quality high
- The fixed code must run without errors

```jsx
// Your fixed code here
```

## Quick Copy Checklist

When implementing each agent:

- [ ] Copy base prompt structure from existing agent
- [ ] Add insights section at the top (NEW for self-improvement)
- [ ] Adapt variable names from TypeScript to Python
- [ ] Replace template literals with f-strings
- [ ] Keep educational frameworks intact (5E, Bloom's, etc.)
- [ ] Include research context from Layer 1
- [ ] Add self-evaluation call after generation
- [ ] Store evaluation in `agent_performance_metrics`
- [ ] **Wrap all AI functions with `@weave.op()` decorator for tracing**

## Summary: Key Changes for WaveHacks 2

### What Changed from Original Implementation

| Aspect | Original | WaveHacks 2 Version |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| **Activity Output** | Text descriptions | Interactive React web pages |
| **Code Length** | Limited to <200 lines | **NO LIMIT** - build comprehensive activities |
| **Gamification** | Mentioned | **Core requirement** - must include game elements |
| **Active Learning** | Suggested | **Mandatory integration** in all activities |
| **Tracing** | Basic logs | **Weave tracing** on all AI calls |
| **Deployment** | N/A | **Daytona sandboxes** for live code execution |
| **Creativity** | Constrained | **Encouraged** - be innovative and fun |

### Activity Creator Focus

**Primary Goal**: Generate engaging, interactive React web pages that:
1. ‚úÖ Include gamification (points, badges, progress)
2. ‚úÖ Follow active learning principles (hook, explore, practice, reflect)
3. ‚úÖ Are visually appealing (Tailwind CSS)
4. ‚úÖ Work in sandboxes (no external dependencies)
5. ‚úÖ Make learning FUN and memorable

**Not**: Simple activity descriptions or offline worksheets (unless absolutely necessary)

### Weave Integration Benefits

Using `@weave.op()` on all AI functions gives you:
- üìä **Visibility**: See all prompts and responses
- üêõ **Debugging**: Trace why evaluations scored low
- üìà **Improvement Tracking**: Visualize score increases over time
- üéØ **Demo Power**: Show judges the agent's reasoning

### Implementation Priority

1. **Strategy Planner** (reuse existing prompts + add insights)
2. **Lesson Creator** (reuse existing 5E framework + add insights)
3. **Activity Creator** (NEW React generation with gamification)
4. **Self-Evaluator** (NEW - critical for self-improvement)
5. **Reflection Loop** (NEW - analyzes patterns and creates insights)

---

**Time Saver**: Don't rewrite prompts from scratch! The existing ones are already well-tested and pedagogically sound. Just adapt the syntax, add self-improvement sections, and wrap with `@weave.op()`.

**Focus on the NEW stuff**: Self-evaluation, React activity generation, and Weave tracing are your differentiators!
